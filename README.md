# HR Analytics Dashboard - Employee Insight & Performance 📊

### 🎯 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **HR Analytics Dashboard** created in Power BI. The goal was to transform raw employee data into actionable insights regarding workforce performance, satisfaction levels, and overall engagement across different departments.

### 🔍 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks several critical metrics:
* **Total Workforce:** 387 employees analyzed.
* **Average Satisfaction:** 62% (identifying areas for workplace improvement).
* **Engagement Score:** 58% (baseline for internal HR initiatives).
* **Efficiency vs. Performance:** Correlation analysis between employee performance scores and work-life balance.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop:** Data modeling and interactive visualization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Created custom measures for engagement and satisfaction averages.
* **Power Query (ETL):** Cleaned and transformed the dataset for accurate reporting.

### 📈 Business Insights
1. **Efficiency Tracking:** The dashboard highlights the distribution of performance scores, allowing HR to identify top talents and those requiring additional support.
2. **Engagement Trends:** Data visualization reveals how engagement varies across departments, pointing to specific teams that might need better integration or management changes.
3. **Satisfaction Drivers:** Analysis of the "Average of Satisfaction" vs "Worker Performance" provides insights into how employee well-being impacts productivity.
